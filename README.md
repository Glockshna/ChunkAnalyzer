Chunk Analyzer Beta 1.0 Mod Minecraft 1.7.10
=======
Note: This is a fork off of Otter In A Suit's original Chunk Analyzer mod. If you are looking for the original project you can find it here: https://github.com/otter-in-a-suit/ChunkAnalyzer 
This version is drastically different from the original project and will continue to diverge.

Content
-----------
This mod adds a machine that allows you to analyze the ore make up of a limited area. 
This mod is intended to be used with mods that modify the ore generation to be more realistic and localized rather than evenly distributed and as is won't really be that useful with vanilla-like ore generation.

Items & Recepies
-----------

Scanner - Scans the chunk it's placed in for ore placed in its inventory.

Config
-----------
useXPForScanner = true|false 

Disclaimer
-----------
This mod is VERY much a work in progress, hence why there are no builds for this fork as of yet. If you would like to help out contact me here or on the MCF (Check the contact section)
