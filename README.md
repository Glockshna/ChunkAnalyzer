Chunk Analyzer Mod Minecraft 1.7.2
=======

Content
-----------
Minecraft-mod for analyzing chunks, finding certain blocks w/o being to OP.
Heavily WIP.
Also, this is my first MC-mod in, like, ever! Yay!

Items & Recepies
-----------
* Wooden Scanner
Analyzes the chunk & places a marker, but will only return a single location & use most XP

* Iron Scanner
Analyzes the chunk & places a marker, will return all locations & uses XP

* Gold Scanner
Analyzes the chunk & places a marker, will return all locations & uses NO XP

* Iron cage
Decreases the explosion-chance drastically. Using 2 iron cages will effectively eliminate the chance of your scanner exploding!

* Chunk analyzer
WIP, not implemented yet
Will be used to analyze the entire chunk

* Terminal-PC
Not implemented yet (as in: no code)
Will be used to control multiple scanners & analyzers in different locations
Also may be the place where the chunk analyzer sends its data to

Config
-----------
useXPForScanner = true|false

Disclaimer
-----------
This is an unfinished version I simply push every time I've worked on something. May or may not work properly. Absolutely no version-control or and branch-logic whatsoever.
But you can have a gander at the code if you like to, provide feedback and stuff. Also, free src-backup for me.
